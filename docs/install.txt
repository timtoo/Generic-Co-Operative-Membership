Installation Instructions
=========================

The current installation documentation is somewhat technical, aimed at
system administrators setting up the Co-operative Membership System on a
server. In the future we hope to have packaging options that will make some of
these steps unnecessary.

Requirements
------------

Major software components:

- Python 2.6
- Django 1.3
- Postgresql 8.4
- Apache 2.2



Setting Up Django
-----------------

First create a Django project that the Co-operative Membership System
application(s) will exist in. The following command will accomplish
this, creating the project subdirectory called "coop":

    django-admin startproject coop

In this directory you will now find a configuration file called
`settings.py`. In that file the following changes need to be made:

- set DEBUG = False
- set ADMINS
- set DATABASE connection info
- set TIME_ZONE and LANGUAGE_CODE
- set ROOT_URLCONF to point to the project urls module
- update INSTALLED_APPS
- add TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
