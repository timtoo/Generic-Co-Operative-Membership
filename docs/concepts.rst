Major Concepts in the Generic Co-operative Membership System
============================================================

The membership system implements the following concepts:

 - Basic member identity and contact info
 - Membership fees
 - Member loans
 - Member work
 - Member roles (such as being on a committee, or the board)
 - Member groups (such as households, or any other grouping desired)
 - Member flags: a generic way to identify attributes of members
 - Rewards: members can be awarded credits of various kinds

Basic member identity and contact info
--------------------------------------

This includes name, address, phone, email.

Membership fees
---------------

Membership fees can be one-time fees, or recurring fees on a monthly,
quarterly, biannual or annual basis.

Fees can be associated with Roles or Flags and automatically appled to
attached members, as well as applied directly.

Member loans
------------

Loans can be optional or required.


Member work
-----------

Many co-operatives require members to do work for the coop. Required
work hours can be assigned automatically to a flag or role attached to
a member.

Roles
-----

A role represents a member's position in the organization. The most
basic role is the "Member" role. Other roles a member might additionally
have associated with them might indicate being part of a committee, or
a position on the board of directors.

Roles have a start and end date associated with them. A record of the
roles that have been associated with the member is maintained in
perpetuity.

Roles may be associated with fees, rewards, or work hour requirements.

Flags
-----

Flags are simple attributes that can be applied to a member. They are
ephemeral in that they can be added and removed at any time.

Flags may be associated with fees, rewards, or work hour requirements.


Rewards
-------

Certain roles or flags may have rewards automatically assocated with
them. Currently the only reward type supported is the awarding of
work hour credits.


Groups
------

Groups are somewhere between a flag and a role. Groups provides an
informal way of assocating groups of members. Fees, rewards and
work can not be associated with groups as they can with roles or flags.
