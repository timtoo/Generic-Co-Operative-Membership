- ui: add note
- ui: event (same as add note?)
- ui: assign required work / add hours completed
- ui: display loan amount

- ui status: support for work required colours
- ui status: support for loan status
- ui status: fees owed status

- edit: member
- add: member
    - test ugly UI
    - auto-complete for city

- autocomplete for search interface? (last name?)

- add city interface

- add fee table?
    - think of a better name: money
    - how to handle recurring fees?
        - are fees due on set dates, annual, quarterly, etc?
- ui: add fee owed
    -
- ui: limited member view

- ability to update some data without making changes live
    - perhaps for now we can record changes as a simple note
        in the event table. Staff can write note describing
        changes / attention needed.

- setup groups if needed during syncdb
- fix dropdown : list item style problem
- random active member feature (for me)


- add data to main page
    - new members this month, last month (graph?)

- add reports
    - check reports in old access database to clone


Later
------

- report of which members have what permissions
- add support for full text search on events
- add search form to menu


Longer Term
----------
- Easier UI for setting permissions for members
- "live search"
- improve search results ui (small target for clicking)

- generic update-pending table... attach to member
    - contains json payload saying what data wants to be changed?
    - things that may need to be done:
        - add work hours ocmpleted
        - change of address or other member details
        - note to administrator
        - etc

- add ability to edit notes
    - overlay controls when hoving over rule
    - when note is edited create new note, and mark the old note as
      inactive

- add 'important' (sticky)  status for notes which remain at top (and
  maybe shaded or outlined for attention)
