- double check not allowing blank notes

- add city interface

- ui: limited member view

- ability to update some data without making changes live
    - perhaps for now we can record changes as a simple note
        in the event table. Staff can write note describing
        changes / attention needed.

- add reports
    - check reports in old access database to clone

- on deactivation: if member has an active loan refund requested flag?
    - on loan refund, remove loan requested flag

- cron: add required work on schedule

- cron: add fee records as needed

- work log
- fee log



Later
------

- autocomplete for search interface? (last name?)
- ui: improve fee select: indicate recuring and other details
- report of which members have what permissions
- add support for full text search on events
- add search form to menu?



Longer Term
----------
- Easier UI for setting permissions for members
- auto-complete for city (current select control is not scalable)
- "live search"
- improve search results ui (small target for clicking)

- generic update-pending table... attach to member
    - contains json payload saying what data wants to be changed?
    - things that may need to be done:
        - add work hours ocmpleted
        - change of address or other member details
        - note to administrator
        - etc

- add ability to edit notes
    - overlay controls when hoving over rule
    - when note is edited create new note, and mark the old note as
      inactive

- add 'important' (sticky)  status for notes which remain at top (and
  maybe shaded or outlined for attention)

- add "needs attention" flag on notes.
    - which means we need a way to remove the needs attention flag
    - record who (last to) removes flag
