Generic Co-operative Membership System.
Copyright 2011 Tim Middleton

A customizable membership system for co-operative organizations. It
includes support for tracking member fees, labour, loans and roles.
It is very customizable allowing arbitrary groups and flags to be
defined.

Documentation is in the "docs" folder. Documentation uses the Sphinx
documentation system; the source documentation files included can be
read as plain text, but generated HTML and other formats are available.
